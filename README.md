Climate change is an urgent problem right now, and if we do not act on it soon, there may be no turning back. Through background research, the team has found that the Earthâ€™s temperature has risen 0.32 Fahrenheit per decade since 1981 (according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Additionally, the team created a physics-based model that predicts the change in global surface temperature based on CO2 emission. Based on this model, the team created a simulator for the users to play with different emission scenarios and see the corresponding global temperature change. This simulator has a user-friendly interface to educate and enlighten people about the pressing climate change problem. This engaging simulator is aimed at increasing awareness of the impact of carbon emissions on climate change and encouraging decisive action-taking to reduce carbon emissions.
